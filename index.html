        The "alert()" and "console.*()" functions that we use in JavaScript are
        not actually included in the JS specification. In fact, many other JS
        APIs and methods such as fetch(), getCurrentLocation(), getUserMeta(),
        and file operation methods like fs.write() are not specified by the TC39
        committee. Although these APIs and methods may look like JavaScript
        functions and object methods, they are not defined by the JS language.
        They follow the syntax rules of JS, but their behaviors are actually
        controlled by the environment in which the JS engine is running.

        Javascript has Backwards compatibility, not forwards! What is backwards
        compatibility? Which means that code written in the past should still
        work in the present and future. This is a critical principle for
        developers who want to create programs that can run for many years
        without becoming outdated or unpredictable. JavaScript's commitment to
        backwards compatibility is impressive, considering the language's almost
        25-year history.
